# Rent-a-VM Web interface
## What even is this
My teacher tasked me with creating a system that would allow people to login and request a vm for word docs or something, also giving the option for a higher end virtual machine for a "payment".<br><br>

Bascically, this is the poor man's vps provider front end.

## How the fuck do I use this?
This app requires Java 11 and rethinkdb. It was built to run ontop of ProxMox Virtual Enviorment, but could probably be adapted to whatever else.
